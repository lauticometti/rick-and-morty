# rick-and-morty
A web app that brings you closer to the famous series "Rick and Morty", where you will find information about all the characters in it.

I'm using Typescript, React and the API ¨rickandmortyapi.com¨ for develop the user interface,  guided by a design that I created in Figma. 
With Express I create the backend and with PostgreSQL the database. 
Sequelize is my chosen ORM and Vite takes care of creating my development environment.
