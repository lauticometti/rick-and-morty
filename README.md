# rick-and-morty
A web app that brings you closer to the famous series "Rick and Morty", where you will find information about all the characters in it.

I am using Typescript, React and the API ¨rickandmortyapi.com¨ for develop the user interface,  guided by a design that I created in Figma. 
With Express I create the backend and with PostgreSQL the database. 
Sequelize is my chosen ORM and Vite takes care of creating my development environment.

## Design
